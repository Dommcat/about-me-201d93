    <p> My Name is Dominick Martin. I live in Seattle, WA. I'm originally from the central valley of California. I have a family of five that includes (two boys and a girl) and we live with seven cats and no dog. I like to play the drums on my free time. I have a BA degree in Political Science and over a decade of experience as a research data analyst. My goal is to increase my software programming knowledge and move into a data science machine learning role in the Seattle area. Thanks for reading a little about me. </p>
